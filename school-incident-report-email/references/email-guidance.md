# Email Templates and Guidance

## Tone and Approach Principles

### Core Principles
- **Maintain collaborative partnership**: Frame communications as working together with the school
- **Acknowledge perspective limitations**: Recognize that the account comes from the child's perspective
- **Document without accusations**: Present facts neutrally for IEP documentation purposes
- **Focus on solutions**: Request specific actions or follow-up rather than dwelling on blame
- **Reference relevant supports**: Connect to IEP/504 accommodations when applicable

### Language to Use
- "We wanted to share..." (not "We need to report...")
- "According to [child's name]..." (acknowledges child's perspective)
- "We're hoping to understand..." (collaborative)
- "We'd appreciate..." (respectful request)
- "To support [child's name]..." (focuses on child's needs)

### Language to Avoid
- Accusatory phrasing ("You failed to...", "The teacher didn't...")
- Absolute statements ("This always happens...", "Nobody ever...")
- Emotional language ("We're furious...", "This is unacceptable...")
- Demands ("You must...", "We require...")

## Email Structure

Each email should include:

1. **Subject line**: Clear, factual, non-inflammatory
2. **Greeting**: Professional but warm
3. **Context**: Brief statement of purpose
4. **Incident description**: Factual account from child's perspective
5. **Impact/concerns**: How this affected the child
6. **Connection to supports**: Reference IEP/504 if relevant
7. **Requested action**: Specific, reasonable follow-up
8. **CC guidance**: Who should be included
9. **Closing**: Collaborative, forward-looking

## Template Variations

### Approach A: Collaborative Inquiry
**When to use**: For first-time incidents, minor issues, or when relationship with school is strong

**Characteristics**:
- Emphasis on understanding what happened
- Frames as seeking clarification
- Softer language throughout
- Invites dialogue

**Example opening**:
"We wanted to reach out to better understand an incident that [child's name] shared with us regarding [date]."

### Approach B: Documentation-Focused
**When to use**: For recurring issues, when building documentation for IEP, or more serious incidents

**Characteristics**:
- More structured and formal
- Clear documentation language
- Explicit reference to IEP/504
- Specific follow-up requests

**Example opening**:
"We are writing to formally document an incident that occurred on [date] involving [child's name], as this relates to [his/her/their] IEP accommodations."

### Approach C: Balanced Professional
**When to use**: Standard approach for most situations, balances documentation needs with relationship maintenance

**Characteristics**:
- Professional but warm tone
- Acknowledges child's perspective explicitly
- Clear about concerns without accusation
- Reasonable follow-up requests

**Example opening**:
"We wanted to share an incident that [child's name] reported to us from [date], as we believe it's important to address together."

## CC Recipients Guidance

### Always CC:
- Case manager/special education coordinator (if child has IEP/504)

### Consider CC based on situation:
- **Principal/Assistant Principal**: For serious safety incidents, repeated issues, or when classroom teacher has been unresponsive
- **School counselor**: For social-emotional incidents, peer conflicts
- **Behavioral specialist**: For behavioral incidents related to IEP goals
- **District special education director**: Only for systemic issues or if building-level response has been inadequate

### Best practice:
Include a line in the email such as: "I'm copying [name/role] to ensure appropriate follow-up and support."

## IEP/504 Reference Guidance

### When to reference:
- Incident relates to accommodations not being provided
- Incident involves a known trigger or area of need documented in IEP
- Requesting accommodations be reviewed or modified
- Building documentation for upcoming IEP meeting

### How to reference:
- Specific: "[Child's name]'s IEP includes a sensory break accommodation, and we understand this was not available during the incident."
- General: "This incident may relate to [child's name]'s IEP goals around social communication."
- Forward-looking: "We'd like to discuss whether [child's name]'s accommodations need adjustment in light of this incident."

### When NOT to reference:
- Don't over-cite IEP for every minor issue
- Don't use IEP as a weapon ("You're violating federal law...")
- Don't reference if incident is clearly unrelated to disability or accommodations
