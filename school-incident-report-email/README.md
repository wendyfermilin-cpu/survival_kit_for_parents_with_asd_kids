## Key Principles

- **Acknowledge Perspective**: Frames incidents from the child's viewpoint
- **Document Without Accusation**: Presents facts neutrally
- **Maintain Collaboration**: Uses partnership language with school staff
- **Solution-Focused**: Requests specific, reasonable follow-up when appropriate
- **Respect IEP/504 Boundaries**: References accommodations only when directly relevant

## Approach Variations

### Collaborative Inquiry
Best for first-time or minor incidents. Emphasizes understanding and dialogue.

### Documentation-Focused
Best for recurring issues or serious incidents. More formal with explicit IEP references.

### Balanced Professional
Standard approach for most situations. Professional but warm, clear without accusation.
