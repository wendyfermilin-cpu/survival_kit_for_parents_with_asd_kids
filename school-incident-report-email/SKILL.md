# School Incident Report Email

Generate professional, respectful emails for parents to report school incidents involving their children with ASD. Creates documentation suitable for IEP discussions while maintaining collaborative school relationships.

## Quick Start

When a parent needs to report a school incident, gather the following information:

1. **Basic details**: Child's name, date/time of incident, incident type (behavioral, academic, safety, communication)
2. **What happened**: Description from child's perspective
3. **Impact**: How it affected the child
4. **Context**: Relevant IEP/504 accommodations (if applicable)
5. **Desired outcome**: What follow-up or support they're requesting
6. **Recipients**: Primary contact (teacher, case manager) and who should be CC'd

Then load the detailed guidance from `references/email-guidance.md` to understand tone principles, structure, and approach variations.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

Ask the parent for incident details. Use open-ended questions:
- "Can you tell me what happened from [child's name]'s perspective?"
- "When did this occur?"
- "How did this affect [child's name]?"
- "Who should receive this email (teacher, principal, case manager)?"
- "Does this relate to any IEP or 504 accommodations?"
- "What outcome or follow-up are you hoping for?"

### Step 2: Load Detailed Guidance

Read `references/email-guidance.md` for:
- Tone and language principles
- Email structure requirements
- Three approach variations (Collaborative Inquiry, Documentation-Focused, Balanced Professional)
- CC recipient guidance
- IEP/504 reference guidelines

### Step 3: Generate Multiple Approaches

Create 2-3 email drafts representing different strategic approaches using the message_compose_v1 tool:

**Approach A - Collaborative Inquiry**: Best for first-time or minor incidents
- Emphasis on understanding and dialogue
- Softer, partnership-focused language
- Frames as seeking clarification

**Approach B - Documentation-Focused**: Best for recurring issues or serious incidents
- More formal and structured
- Explicit IEP/504 references
- Clear documentation language
- Specific follow-up requests

**Approach C - Balanced Professional**: Standard approach for most situations
- Professional but warm
- Explicitly acknowledges child's perspective
- Clear concerns without accusation
- Reasonable requests

### Step 4: Include CC Guidance

For each email, provide a note about who should be CC'd:
- Always include case manager/special education coordinator (if IEP/504 exists)
- Suggest additional recipients based on incident severity and type
- Explain reasoning for CC recommendations

### Step 5: Review and Refine

After presenting the drafts, ask if the parent wants:
- Adjustments to tone (more/less formal)
- Changes to requested follow-up
- Different CC recipients
- Additional context or details

## Key Principles

**Acknowledge perspective limitations**: Always frame the incident as "according to [child's name]" or "as [child's name] shared with us" to recognize it's from the child's viewpoint.

**Document without accusation**: Present facts neutrally. Use phrases like "we wanted to share" instead of "we need to report." Avoid "you failed" or "the teacher didn't."

**Maintain collaboration**: Frame as working together with the school. Use "we're hoping to understand" and "we'd appreciate" rather than demands.

**Be solution-focused**: Request specific, reasonable follow-up. Focus on what would help rather than dwelling on what went wrong.

**Respect IEP/504 boundaries**: Reference accommodations when directly relevant, but don't weaponize them or cite for every minor issue.

## Examples

### Example 1: Sensory Overload During Fire Drill

**User input**: "My son had a meltdown during yesterday's fire drill. He has sensory sensitivities and the loud alarm was overwhelming. His teacher sent him to the office. He has a sensory break accommodation in his IEP."

**Appropriate response**: Generate 2-3 email approaches that:
- Acknowledge this is from the child's perspective
- Describe the meltdown factually
- Reference the sensory break accommodation
- Request discussion about fire drill accommodations
- Suggest CC'ing the case manager and possibly OT
- Maintain respectful, collaborative tone

### Example 2: Peer Conflict at Recess

**User input**: "My daughter said another student pushed her at recess today and called her names. She's really upset. She has social communication goals in her IEP."

**Appropriate response**: Generate 2-3 email approaches that:
- Frame as child's account of incident
- Express concern about physical and verbal interaction
- Note impact on child's emotional state
- Request investigation and follow-up
- Reference social communication goals if relevant
- Suggest CC'ing counselor and case manager
- Avoid accusing the other student directly

### Example 3: Missed Assignment Accommodation

**User input**: "The teacher marked my son's assignment late even though he's supposed to get extended time. This happens a lot."

**Appropriate response**: Generate 2-3 email approaches that:
- Describe pattern of accommodation not being provided
- Reference specific extended time accommodation
- Request clarification on implementation process
- Suggest meeting to ensure consistent implementation
- Note this is for documentation purposes
- Maintain respectful tone while being clear about concern
- Suggest CC'ing case manager
